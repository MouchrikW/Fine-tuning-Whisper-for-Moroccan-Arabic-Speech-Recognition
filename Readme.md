Breaking down the code in super simple terms:

Imagine you have a bunch of audio files where people are talking, and you also have text files telling you what they said in those audio files. We want the computer to learn how to listen to the audio and then write down the words it heard—this is called a "speech-to-text" model. The code you’re looking at trains and evaluates a model to do this job.

Let’s go through the code step-by-step and explain all the pieces and why they’re there.
Importing Stuff

import os
import pandas as pd
from datasets import Dataset, Audio, concatenate_datasets
from transformers import (
    WhisperForConditionalGeneration,
    WhisperProcessor,
    Seq2SeqTrainingArguments,
    Seq2SeqTrainer,
    GenerationConfig,
    EarlyStoppingCallback
)
import torch
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Any
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader
from tqdm import tqdm
import evaluate

    os: Helps us deal with file paths and directories.
    pandas (pd): Makes it easy to read CSV (spreadsheet-like) files and handle data in tables.
    datasets (from Hugging Face): A toolkit that helps load and handle training/evaluation data easily.
    transformers (from Hugging Face): Has ready-to-use AI models and tools, like Whisper (a speech-to-text model).
    torch (PyTorch): A popular library for building and training neural networks.
    dataclasses, typing: Helps define and structure certain classes and code more cleanly.
    tqdm: Shows a nice progress bar when loops run, so you can see how fast things are going.
    evaluate: Helps measure how good the model is doing by comparing predictions to actual answers.

Why do we need all these libraries?
Because training a speech-to-text model involves:

    Loading data and cleaning it (pandas, datasets, os).
    Using pre-made AI model helpers (transformers, Whisper).
    Actually running the model (torch).
    Measuring performance (evaluate).

Loading the Data

def load_data(csv_file, wav_dir):
    df = pd.read_csv(csv_file, sep='\t')
    df = df.dropna(subset=['wav', 'words'])  # remove rows that have missing audio or text
    df['audio'] = df['wav'].apply(lambda x: os.path.join(wav_dir, x))
    df = df[df['audio'].apply(os.path.exists)]
    df = df.rename(columns={'words': 'transcription'})
    df = df[['audio', 'transcription']]
    dataset = Dataset.from_pandas(df)
    dataset = dataset.cast_column("audio", Audio(sampling_rate=16000))
    return dataset

What’s happening here?

    Read a CSV file that has info about which audio file goes with which text.
        The CSV file probably has columns like wav (the name of the audio file) and words (the correct text for that audio).

    Clean the data by:
        Dropping rows that have no audio or no text.
        Making sure the audio file actually exists in the folder we point to.

    Rename "words" to "transcription" because that’s just a clearer name for the text we have.

    Turn the pandas DataFrame into a Hugging Face Dataset, which is a format that the model training code likes.

    Tell it that the audio column is actually audio data and how to handle it. This Audio() thing will load and process the audio automatically at the right sampling rate (16000 samples per second is standard for speech models).

Why do we do this?
We need a clean, well-structured dataset so our model can “see” what audio maps to what text. If the model sees messed-up data, it can’t learn properly.
Data Collator

@dataclass
class DataCollatorSpeechSeq2SeqWithPadding:
    processor: Any

    def _call_(self, features):
        input_features = []
        label_features = []

        for feature in features:
            speech_array = feature["audio"]["array"]
            sampling_rate = feature["audio"]["sampling_rate"]

            # Convert audio into input features the model can understand
            input_feature = self.processor.feature_extractor(
                speech_array, sampling_rate=sampling_rate, return_tensors="pt"
            ).input_features[0]
            input_features.append({"input_features": input_feature})

            # Convert transcription text into token IDs (numbers)
            labels = self.processor.tokenizer(
                feature["transcription"], return_tensors="pt"
            ).input_ids[0]
            label_features.append({"input_ids": labels})

        # Pad all inputs to the same length
        batch = self.processor.feature_extractor.pad(input_features, return_tensors="pt")
        # Pad all labels (words turned into numbers) to the same length
        labels_batch = self.processor.tokenizer.pad(label_features, return_tensors="pt", padding=True)

        # The model doesn’t need to pay attention to padding tokens, so we mask them with -100.
        labels = labels_batch["input_ids"].masked_fill(labels_batch["attention_mask"].ne(1), -100)
        batch["labels"] = labels

        return batch

What’s happening here?

    The “collator” takes in a bunch of data samples (audio + text) and turns them into a batch that the model can read at once.
    It “tokenizes” the text. Tokenizing means turning words into numbers that the model understands.
    It “extracts features” from the audio. Audio isn’t numbers like text; it’s a wave signal. The processor turns that wave into a list of numbers that represent the sounds.
    Why pad? Models like to work with fixed-size chunks. If one audio is shorter or the text is shorter, we add padding to make them all equal length. Padding is like adding blank space so everything lines up nicely.
    Why -100 for labels? The model should ignore these padded spots and not get confused or punished for them.

In simple terms: this code makes sure everything fits nicely and uniformly so the model can eat it up in one go.
Evaluation Function

def evaluate_model(model, dataset, processor, device, generation_config):
    model.eval()
    wer_metric = evaluate.load("wer")
    dataloader = DataLoader(
        dataset,
        batch_size=2,
        collate_fn=data_collator,
        shuffle=False,
        num_workers=4,
        pin_memory=True,
    )

    predictions = []
    references = []

    for batch in tqdm(dataloader, desc="Evaluating"):
        batch = {k: v.to(device) for k, v in batch.items()}

        with torch.no_grad():  # don’t update model weights here
            outputs = model.generate(
                input_features=batch["input_features"],
                attention_mask=torch.ones_like(batch["input_features"], dtype=torch.long),
                generation_config=generation_config,
            )

        pred_str = processor.batch_decode(outputs, skip_special_tokens=True)
        label_ids = batch["labels"].cpu().numpy()
        label_ids[label_ids == -100] = processor.tokenizer.pad_token_id
        label_str = processor.batch_decode(label_ids, skip_special_tokens=True)

        predictions.extend(pred_str)
        references.extend(label_str)

    wer = wer_metric.compute(predictions=predictions, references=references)
    print(f"WER on test dataset: {wer}")

What’s happening here?

    model.eval(): We put the model in evaluation mode, meaning we’re just checking how good it is, not training it.
    We create a dataloader to go through the evaluation dataset. The data_collator is again used to format the data.
    For each batch:
        Move data to GPU if available (that’s what device means—it could be a graphics card to speed things up).
        model.generate(...): This makes the model listen to the audio and come up with text predictions.
        processor.batch_decode(outputs): Convert the model’s numeric predictions back into text strings.
        We do the same for the reference (the correct text) by decoding the labels.
    Compute the WER (Word Error Rate). WER is a number that says how many words the model got wrong. Lower is better.

Why do we do this?
So we know if our model is actually doing a good job at understanding speech and producing correct transcriptions.

    print(f"Saving model to {output_dir}")
    trainer.save_model(output_dir)
    processor.save_pretrained(output_dir)
    print("Model and processor have been saved successfully.")

    evaluate_model(model, test_dataset, processor, device, generation_config)

Step by step:

    Choose a device (CPU or GPU): If you have a GPU, training goes faster.
    Set file paths: Where the audio and text data are located.
    Load datasets (train, dev, test) with the load_data function we explained before.
    Combine train and dev datasets: People often combine them to have more training data.
    Load a pre-trained model (Whisper) and a processor.**
        The processor knows how to turn audio into model-friendly input and text into tokens.
        The model is the brain that will learn from these features.
    Set model configuration: Tells the model it’s working with Arabic language, for instance.
    Create data_collator: This will make batches during training.
    Set up training arguments: How many steps, how often to save, how fast to learn, etc.
        per_device_train_batch_size=2 means we handle two examples at once per device.
        learning_rate=1e-5 sets how fast the model adjusts its weights.
        max_steps=1000 means we will run 1000 training steps.
    Create a trainer: This is a Hugging Face shortcut that handles a lot of the training work for us (like looping through the data, updating model weights, saving models, etc.).
    trainer.train(): Starts the actual training process. The model listens to audio, tries to guess the text, sees how wrong it is, and then fixes itself (updating weights) to improve next time.
    Save the model and processor: So you can use them later without retraining.
    Run evaluate_model on the test dataset: Check how well the final model does.

In the Most Dumbed-Down Way Possible:

    We load a bunch of audio clips and their matching text.
    We turn all that data into a format the model understands:
        Audio → Numbers that represent sound.
        Text → Numbers that represent words.
    We feed this prepared data into a model that was already trained a bit (a pre-trained Whisper model).
    We let the model train more on our data to make it better at understanding this specific language or accent. Training means it listens to audio, guesses text, compares it with the real text, and learns from its mistakes.
    After the training, we test the model on new audio it hasn’t heard before to see how many mistakes it makes (that’s the WER score).
    We save everything so we can use the model later.

Why do we do all of this?

The ultimate goal is to have a machine that can listen to spoken words in audio files and accurately write them down. The code sets up a pipeline that:

    Reads and cleans the data
    Prepares the model and training settings
    Trains the model to improve it
    Checks how good it is
    Saves the trained model

This is all about taking raw audio + text data and making the model better at converting speech to text.
